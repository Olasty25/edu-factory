**Notes: Lalka – Summary**

"Lalka" (The Doll) is a novel by Bolesław Prus, published in 1889. It is a complex work of social realism, exploring the themes of materialism, morality, and the conflict between tradition and modernity in 19th century Poland.

The main character of the novel is Stanisław Wokulski, a self-made businessman and scientist. He becomes infatuated with Izabela Łęcka, a beautiful young woman from a wealthy and aristocratic family. Despite his love for Izabela, Wokulski is unable to bridge the gap between their two worlds.

The novel explores the superficiality and artifice of the Polish aristocracy, as represented by the symbol of the doll. Wokulski's infatuation with Izabela is a form of self-delusion, as she is ultimately unattainable and unworthy of his love.

The novel also explores the themes of materialism and morality. Wokulski's desire for success and security leads him to make compromises, both ethical and personal. In the end, he is left alone and disillusioned, as the values of the aristocracy prove to be shallow and unsatisfying.

"Lalka" is a powerful critique of the materialistic values of 19th century Polish society, and a poignant exploration of the human desire for love and connection. It remains one of the most enduring works of Polish literature.
