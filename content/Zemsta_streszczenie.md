# Notes: Zemsta – Understanding the Film

"Revenge" (2017) is a French action thriller directed by Coralie Fargeat. The movie follows the story of Jen, a young woman who goes on a retreat to a desert villa with her wealthy boyfriend Richard and his friends. However, the retreat takes a dark turn when Richard betrays Jen and is involved in her attempted murder.

The film is a commentary on gender dynamics and the objectification of women in film and society. Jen is presented as an object of desire for the male characters, who view her as a plaything rather than a person. This is exemplified in a scene where Richard's friends watch Jen skinny dipping through a telescope.

Jen's revenge against her oppressors is portrayed as a journey of self-discovery, as she transforms from a vulnerable victim to a fierce survivor. The film's graphic violence and gore serve to highlight the brutality of the male characters' actions towards Jen and the consequences of their betrayal.

The cinematography and setting of the film also play a significant role in creating a distinct atmosphere. The desert landscape is used to emphasize Jen's isolation and vulnerability, while the use of bright colors and wide shots highlight the beauty of the natural environment.

Overall, "Revenge" is a powerful and thought-provoking film that challenges traditional gender dynamics and offers a fresh perspective on the revenge genre. It is a must-watch for fans of action, thriller, and horror films.
