# Notes - RNA: Types and Functions

RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) is a nucleic acid type that plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including protein synthesis and gene expression. RNA molecules are usually single-stranded and contain ribose sugar with a hydroxyl group at the 2' carbon position, unlike DNA, which contains deoxyribose sugar. Additionally, RNA molecules contain uracil as a nitrogenous base instead of thymine in DNA. There are different RNA types, including mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, and other non-coding RNA types.

## mRNA (Messenger RNA)

mRNA is responsible for carrying genetic information from DNA to the ribosome. Once the mRNA molecule is transcribed from the DNA, it moves out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it attaches to the ribosome. The ribosome then translates the genetic information in the mRNA into a sequence of amino acids, which form a protein. mRNA molecules are usually shorter than DNA molecules and may contain introns and exons that need to be spliced out before translation.

## tRNA (Transfer RNA)

tRNA is responsible for translating mRNA into amino acids. tRNA molecules are small and contain a cloverleaf structure with four arms, including the acceptor arm, D arm, anticodon arm, and TψC arm. Each tRNA molecule has an anticodon, a sequence of three nucleotides that recognize a complementary codon on the mRNA during translation. Additionally, tRNA molecules contain an amino acid attachment site, where an amino acid is attached to the tRNA before being added to the growing polypeptide chain during protein synthesis.

## rRNA (Ribosomal RNA)

rRNA is a part of ribosomes, the complex macromolecular machines responsible for protein synthesis. Ribosomes contain two subunits, a large and small subunit. Each subunit contains rRNA and several proteins that work together to translate mRNA into a sequence of amino acids. rRNA plays a crucial role in the structure and function of ribosomes, and it helps catalyze peptide bond formation during protein synthesis.

## Other Non-coding RNA Types

There are several other non-coding RNA types, including microRNA (miRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). These non-coding RNA molecules play various roles in regulating gene expression, post-transcriptional modifications, and other biological processes. Understanding the functions and mechanisms of these non-coding RNA types is an active area of research in molecular biology.
