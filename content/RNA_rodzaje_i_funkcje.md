Flashcards
----------

1. **mRNA** - Messenger RNA; contains genetic information from DNA to be translated into proteins; present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
2. **tRNA** - Transfer RNA; carries amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis; present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
3. **rRNA** - Ribosomal RNA; is a component of ribosomes and plays a crucial role in protein synthesis; present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
4. **miRNA** - Micro RNA; small non-coding RNA molecules that function in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression; present in eukaryotic cells.
5. **siRNA** - Small interfering RNA; plays a role in RNA interference (RNAi), mechanism of gene silencing; present in eukaryotic cells.

Notes

RNA (Ribonucleic acid) is a nucleic acid present in all living cells. It is a single-stranded molecule made up of a long chain of nucleotides. The monomer unit of RNA is ribose, a five-carbon sugar, and a nitrogenous base. The nitrogenous bases found in RNA are adenine, uracil, guanine, and cytosine.

There are several types of RNA with different functions, including:

1. **mRNA (Messenger RNA)**: mRNA contains genetic information copied from DNA in the process of transcription. It carries this information to the ribosomes, where it serves as a template for protein synthesis during translation. mRNA is present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
2. **tRNA (Transfer RNA)**: tRNA is responsible for bringing the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis. Each tRNA molecule has a specific anticodon sequence that binds to the complementary codon on the mRNA, leading to the addition of the correct amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain. tRNAs are present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
3. **rRNA (Ribosomal RNA)**: rRNA is a component of ribosomes, which are complex structures composed of proteins and rRNA. Ribosomes play a crucial role in protein synthesis, serving as the site where translation occurs. rRNA is present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
4. **non-coding RNA**: non-coding RNA refers to RNA molecules that do not encode proteins. Examples of non-coding RNA include:
	* **miRNA (Micro RNA)**: miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that function in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. They typically bind to the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of target mRNAs, leading to translational repression or degradation of the mRNA.
	* **siRNA (Small interfering RNA)**: siRNAs are double-stranded RNAs involved in RNA interference (RNAi), a mechanism for gene silencing. They function by degrading complementary mRNA molecules, thereby preventing their translation into proteins.

In summary, RNA plays a critical role in various biological processes, including protein synthesis, gene regulation, and RNA silencing. Understanding the different types of RNA and their functions is essential for a comprehensive understanding of molecular biology and genetics.
