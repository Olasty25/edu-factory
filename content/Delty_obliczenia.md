# Notes - Delta of Computation

Delta of Computation is a concept used in computer science to measure the performance of algorithms. It refers to the extra time required to execute a program on a given input, compared to the time required to execute the same program on a smaller input. The Delta of Computation can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the size of the input, the efficiency of the algorithms used, and the speed of the hardware on which the program is run.

To reduce the Delta of Computation, several techniques can be employed. Memoization, for example, involves storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again. This can significantly reduce the time required to execute a program, particularly when the same inputs are used multiple times.

Another technique for reducing Delta of Computation is Divide and Conquer. This approach involves breaking a problem down into smaller sub-problems, solving each sub-problem independently, and then combining the solutions to solve the original problem. Divide and Conquer algorithms can be very efficient, particularly for problems that can be solved in linear time.

It is important to note, however, that not all algorithms are created equal. Some algorithms are inherently more efficient than others, and may be better suited to certain types of problems. When selecting an algorithm for a particular task, it is important to consider the nature of the problem, the size of the input, and the desired level of performance. By making informed decisions about algorithm selection, developers can help ensure that their programs run as efficiently as possible, and that the Delta of Computation is kept to a minimum.
