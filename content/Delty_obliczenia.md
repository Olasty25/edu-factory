# Notatki: Delta of Computation
Delta of computation is a key concept in understanding the scalability of algorithms. It refers to the change in compute time as the size of the input changes. Generally, a higher input size leads to a higher delta of computation. Problems with a high delta of computation, such as matrix multiplication, can require a large amount of resources for large inputs. This can lead to increased power consumption and can be a major limitation for high-performance computing. To improve the scalability of algorithms, it is important to consider the delta of computation and design algorithms that have a lower delta for larger inputs. Additionally, avoiding or minimizing floating-point operations, which tend to increase the delta of computation, can help improve scalability. By being aware of the delta of computation and designing algorithms with scalability in mind, it is possible to create more efficient and resource-friendly algorithms that perform well for large inputs.
