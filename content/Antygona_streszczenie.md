"Antigone" is a tragedy written by Sophocles, a prominent Greek playwright. The play is named after the protagonist, Antigone, who faces a moral dilemma when her brother, Polynices, is denied proper burial by their uncle, Creon, the king of Thebes.

Antigone decides to bury her brother, despite Creon's decree, and faces the consequences of her actions when she is caught and sentenced to death. Creon's obstinacy is a result of his hubris and his inability to see the error of his ways, leading to the downfall of both Antigone and Creon.

The conflict in "Antigone" is primarily between Antigone, who believes Creon's decree is unjust and immoral, and Creon, who is determined to maintain his authority and uphold his laws. The Chorus, a group of elder Thebans in the play, acts as a moral compass, providing commentary on the action and attempting to persuade Creon to change his mind.

Ultimately, Creon realizes his mistake too late, and both Antigone and his own son, Haemon, who is engaged to Antigone, are dead. The play highlights the dangers of hubris and the importance of upholding morality and justice in the face of unjust laws.

In "Antigone", Sophocles explores several themes, including the conflict between state laws and individual morality, the role of the gods in human affairs, and the limitations of human authority and power. The play is an enduring masterpiece of Greek tragedy and has inspired numerous adaptations and interpretations throughout history.
