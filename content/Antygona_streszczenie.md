Antygona, authored by Sophocles, is a Greek tragedy that explores the conflict between individual conviction and authority. The play is set in Thebes, where Kreon, the king, has issued an edict forbidding the burial of Polyneices, Antigone's brother, who has been killed in battle. Antigone, however, defies Kreon's order and buries her brother, asserting that divine law demands the burial of the dead, regardless of their actions in life. This act of defiance sets off a chain of events that leads to Antigone's death and the ruin of Kreon's family. The play highlights the tragic consequences of moral absolutism, examining the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of compassion and understanding. The chorus, made up of the citizens of Thebes, provides commentary and insight on the action of the play, reflecting on the themes of destiny, free will, and the human condition. Through its exploration of these themes, Antygona remains a powerful and enduring work of literature, resonating with readers across time and culture.
