The Golgi apparatus, also known as the Golgi complex or Golgi body, is a membrane-bound organelle found in eukaryotic cells. It plays a crucial role in the processing and transport of proteins and lipids.

The Golgi apparatus is composed of stacks of flattened membrane-bound sacs called cisternae. These stacks are typically arranged in a parallel fashion, with the cis face (the side closest to the endoplasmic reticulum) and the trans face (the side closest to the plasma membrane).

Proteins and lipids synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are transported to the Golgi apparatus in vesicles. Once they arrive at the Golgi apparatus, they undergo a series of modifications, including the addition of carbohydrates to form glycoproteins, the addition of fatty acids and other molecules to form complex lipids, and the removal of signal sequences that direct the proteins to their final destinations.

The Golgi apparatus sorts the modified proteins and lipids into vesicles, which bud off from the trans face and are transported to their final destinations. These vesicles can be transported to the plasma membrane for exocytosis, to lysosomes for degradation, or to other organelles for further processing.

The Golgi apparatus also plays a role in the formation of lysosomes, which are membrane-bound organelles that contain enzymes for breaking down and recycling cellular waste. The Golgi apparatus modifies and sorts proteins that will become part of the lysosomal membrane, and it also produces vesicles that fuse with lysosomes to deliver hydrolytic enzymes.

Overall, the Golgi apparatus is a vital organelle for the proper functioning of eukaryotic cells. Its role in the modification and sorting of proteins and lipids ensures that these molecules reach their correct destinations and perform their intended functions.
