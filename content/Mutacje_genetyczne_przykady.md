# Notes (Genetic Mutations Examples)

Genetic mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a gene. They can occur spontaneously or can be caused by environmental factors such as radiation and mutagenic chemicals. Mutations can be beneficial, neutral or harmful to an organism, depending on the specific change and the location of the mutation within the genome.

Point mutations are a type of genetic mutation that involves a change in a single base pair of DNA. They can be classified as either missense mutations, in which a single DNA base pair is changed, resulting in a different amino acid, or nonsense mutations, in which a single DNA base pair is changed, resulting in a stop codon.

Frameshift mutations are a type of genetic mutation that involves the insertion or deletion of a number of base pairs that is not a multiple of three. This causes a shift in the reading frame of the mRNA, leading to the production of an entirely different protein. Frameshift mutations are often harmful or fatal to an organism.

Beneficial mutations are a type of genetic mutation that confers a selective advantage to the organism. They can increase the organism's fitness, allowing it to survive and reproduce more successfully than other members of its population. Examples of beneficial mutations include the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria and the resistance to certain diseases in plants.

Nonsense mutations are a type of genetic mutation that results in a premature stop codon in the mRNA, leading to the production of a truncated protein. Nonsense mutations can be particularly harmful to an organism, as the protein produced may be nonfunctional or may not be produced at all. Nonsense mutations are a common cause of genetic disorders.
