## Notes

Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics dealing with the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles. The three primary trigonometric functions are sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan), with their reciprocals cosecant (csc), secant (sec), and cotangent (cot), respectively. The sine and cosine are based on a right triangle, with sine being the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite the given angle to the length of the hypotenuse, and cosine being the ratio of the length of the side that is adjacent to the given angle to the length of the hypotenuse.

A unit circle is a circle with radius 1, centered at the origin (0,0) in the Cartesian coordinate system. When we think of trigonometric functions in terms of a unit circle, the hypotenuse is always equal to 1. As a result, we can simplify sine and cosine as the y-coordinate and x-coordinate, respectively, of a point on the circle corresponding to a given angle.

The trigonometric functions have various identities and relationships, one of which is the fundamental pythagorean identity for sine and cosine functions: sin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1. This relationship can help us find missing side lengths or angles in right triangles.

Inverse trigonometric functions, arcsine, arccosine and arctangent, are used to find the measure of an angle whose sine, cosine, or tangent, is known. These inverse functions are multivalued, meaning they have many possible answers. For this reason, it is common to restrict the output to a certain domain.

Practical uses for trigonometry are abundant. You can use trigonometry in astronomy to understand the position of celestial objects, in physics to study waves and vibrations, or in geolocation with GPS technology. Trigonometry is a powerful tool that creates a foundation for understanding and solving complex problems in the world of mathematics and beyond.
