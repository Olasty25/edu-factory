## Notatki

Tartuffe, the main character of the play, is a hypocritical religious fraud who pretends to be a holy man. He infiltrates the household of Orgon, a wealthy man who is easily manipulated by Tartuffe's false piety. Despite his family's warnings, Orgon remains blind to Tartuffe's true nature and starts to trust him more and more.

Elmire, Orgon's second wife, is aware of Tartuffe's deceit and tries to expose him. She devises a plan to trap Tartuffe into confessing his true intentions, which eventually leads Orgon to see Tartuffe for who he really is.

Pernelle, Orgon's mother, initially supports Tartuffe, but her views change throughout the play. She eventually becomes convinced of Tartuffe's deceit and helps Orgon and his family expel him from the household.

Dorine, a servant in the household, is also aware of Tartuffe's deceit and tries to expose him. She provides comedic relief throughout the play, often mocking Tartuffe's false piety and hypocrisy.

The play ends with Tartuffe's deceit exposed, and he is expelled from the household. Orgon learns a valuable lesson about trust and the importance of listening to those around him. The play is a commentary on the dangers of hypocrisy and the power of truth and honesty.
