# Notes: Makbet Analysis of Characters

Macbeth is a tragic play written by William Shakespeare, which revolves around the character of Macbeth, a brave and noble Scottish general, who is led to commit regicide by his ambitious wife, Lady Macbeth. The play explores the themes of ambition, guilt, and the corrupting influence of unchecked power, as Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's initial desires for power and wealth escalate into a spiral of violence and paranoia.

Macbeth, initially a brave and loyal soldier, is corrupted by his ambition and the prophecy of the three witches that he will become king. He becomes consumed by the desire to seize the throne, even if it means murdering the rightful king, Duncan. Macbeth's hesitation to commit the murder is quickly overcome by Lady Macbeth's manipulations, and he kills Duncan off-stage.

Lady Macbeth, who is portrayed as a powerful and manipulative character, is initially the driving force behind Macbeth's ambition to become king. She encourages and urges him to commit regicide, and when he hesitates, she calls him a coward. However, after Duncan's murder, Lady Macbeth is haunted by guilt and eventually goes mad.

Banquo, Macbeth's loyal friend, is a brave soldier who is aware of Macbeth's ambition. He is killed by Macbeth to prevent the witches' prophecy that he will become the father of future kings from coming true. Fleance, Banquo's son, escapes and becomes a threat to Macbeth's reign.

Duncan, the rightful king of Scotland, is portrayed as a wise and just ruler, who is loved by his subjects. His murder is a turning point in the play and marks the beginning of Macbeth's downfall.

Macduff, a Scottish nobleman, seeks revenge for the murder of his family and ultimately kills Macbeth in the final act. He represents the forces of good and justice that oppose Macbeth's tyranny and evil.

In conclusion, the characters in Shakespeare's Macbeth are complex and multifaceted, each representing different aspects of human nature, such as ambition, loyalty, guilt, and the corrupting influence of power. The play explores the consequences of unchecked ambition and the destructive power of guilt, as Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's desire for power leads to their downfall.
