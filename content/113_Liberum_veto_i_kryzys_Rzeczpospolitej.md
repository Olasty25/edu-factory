# Notatki: Liberum Veto and the Crisis of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth

The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was a unique political entity in early modern Europe, characterized by its decentralized power structure and the strong influence of the nobility. The Golden Liberty, a set of privileges granted to the nobility, ensured their dominance in the political life of the Commonwealth. One of the most significant aspects of the Golden Liberty was the Liberum Veto, a law that allowed any member of the Sejm to veto a decision, effectively paralyzing the decision-making process.

The Liberum Veto was introduced in the 17th century and had far-reaching consequences for the Commonwealth. It led to the weakening of the central government, as the Sejm was unable to make important decisions regarding the country's foreign and domestic policy. The paralysis of decision-making also had economic consequences, as the Commonwealth was unable to implement necessary reforms and modernize its economy.

The Liberum Veto was abolished in 1791, as part of the Constitution of May 3rd, which aimed to strengthen the central government and modernize the Commonwealth. However, it was too late to save the country from external threats. The Commonwealth was partitioned between Russia, Prussia, and Austria in the late 18th century, and ceased to exist as a political entity.

In conclusion, the Liberum Veto was a significant factor in the crisis of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. It led to the weakening of the central government, the paralysis of decision-making, and the inability to implement necessary reforms. The abolition of the Liberum Veto in 1791 was a step towards modernization, but it was too late to save the Commonwealth from external threats.
