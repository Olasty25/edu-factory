# Flashcards
Here are five flashcards to help you review homographic functions.

1. **Homographic Function**
   A function of the form `f(x) = (ax + b) / (cx + d)`, where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are real numbers and `c` is nonzero.
2. **Increasing/Decreasing**
   A homographic function is either increasing if `a/c > 0` or decreasing if `a/c < 0`.
3. **Vertical Asymptote**
   If the denominator of a homographic function is zero for some value of `x`, then `x` is a vertical asymptote of the function.
4. **Root/X-intercept**
   A homographic function has a root if `b/d` is a solution of `f(x) = 0`; the root is also known as the x-intercept.
5. **Horizontal Asymptote**
   The horizontal asymptote of a homographic function `f(x)` is `y = a/c` if the degrees of `a` and `c` are equal; if the degree of `a` is greater than that of `c`, then there is no horizontal asymptote.

# Notes
Homographic functions, also known as rational functions, belong to an important family of functions that can be expressed as the ratio of two linear functions. Learning how to recognize and work with homographic functions will greatly enhance your understanding of algebraic and calculus concepts.

**Characteristics of homographic functions**

* A homographic function takes the form of `f(x) = (ax + b) / (cx + d)`, where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are real numbers and `c` is nonzero.
* Homographic functions are classified as either increasing or decreasing depending on the sign of `a/c`.
* A homographic function has a vertical asymptote at `x = -d/c` if `c` is nonzero.
* The root or x-intercept of a homographic function occurs at `x = -b/a` if `a` and `b` are not both zero.
* Homographic functions with the same degree in the numerator and denominator have a horizontal asymptote that is the ratio of the leading coefficients of the numerator and denominator.

**Manipulating and analyzing homographic functions**

* A homographic function can be multiplied by `cx + d` to remove the denominator, resulting in a polynomial of degree one (linear function) or degree two (quadratic function).
* The derivative of a homographic function is `f'(x) = (ad - bc)/(cx + d)^2`.
* The second derivative of a homographic function is `f''(x) = -2(ad - bc)/(cx + d)^3`.
* The first derivative of a homographic function can be used to determine the intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing.
* The second derivative of a homographic function can be used to determine the concavity and inflection points of the function, as well as their nature.

**Graphing homographic functions**

* A homographic function is continuous over its entire domain unless it has a vertical asymptote.
* The graph of a homographic function can cross the x-axis at most once, although it could have no x-intercepts.
* The graph of an increasing homographic function opens upward, whereas the graph of a decreasing homographic function opens downward.
* The degree of a homographic function affects its end behavior and the number of horizontal asymptotes it has.
