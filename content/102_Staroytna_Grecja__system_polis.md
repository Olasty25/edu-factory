# Notatki: System Polis in Ancient Greece

The ancient Greek world was characterized by the dominance of the polis, or city-state, as the primary political, economic, and cultural unit. Each polis typically consisted of a city and its attached hinterland, with a combined population of several thousand inhabitants.

A polis exhibited certain defining features, including a shared religion, culture, and government. Its political organization was based on the citizenry, with citizens enjoying significant autonomy in decision-making. However, the principles of citizenship varied across the polis, with definitions influenced by factors such as gender, age, property ownership, and place of origin. Athens, for instance, embraced a more inclusive perspective on citizenship, while Sparta maintained strict criteria for citizenship.

As the core of the polis, the city showcased architectural and artistic achievements that reflected the political power, economic capacity, and cultural identity of its residents. It also offered the essential commercial space for carrying out trade and other economic activities. The Acropolis, serving as the citadel or upper town, was often a significant feature in a polis, featuring religious and cultural buildings, and sometimes serving as a military fortification.

Three prominent polis states in Ancient Greece were Athens, Sparta, and Corinth, which developed distinct governmental systems, military strategies, and societal norms. Athens nurtured a thriving intellectual climate and direct democracy, while Sparta emphasized militaristic discipline and ancestral traditions. Corinth, on the other hand, prospered from maritime trade, resulting in affluent urbanism and artistic evolution.

The polis system molded the Greek civilization into a collection of fiercely independent and diverse entities, fostering competition and cultural advancements. It remained an essential aspect of Greek life and society for nearly a thousand years, until gradually giving way to the rise of Hellenistic kingdoms and eventually the Roman Empire.
