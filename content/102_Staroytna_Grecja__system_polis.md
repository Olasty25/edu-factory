# Notatki: System Polis in Ancient Greece

Ancient Greece was not a unified country, but was instead made up of many independent city-states known as poleis. Each polis was a self-governing entity, consisting of a city and its surrounding territory. The city was typically fortified and located on a hill or other elevated area for defense. The term "acropolis" refers to the highest point in a city, often used for religious and cultural buildings.

The most famous poleis were Athens and Sparta. Athens was known for its democracy, a system of government in which power was held by the people, either directly or through elected representatives. In contrast, Sparta was an oligarchy, a system of government in which power was held by a small group of people.

In Athens, all free adult male citizens had the right to vote on laws and policies, and to serve in public office. This was a radical departure from other systems of government at the time, which were typically monarchies or oligarchies. Athenian democracy was also characterized by the use of juries made up of ordinary citizens, and the practice of ostracism, in which citizens could vote to exile a leader for a period of 10 years.

Sparta, on the other hand, was a militaristic society in which power was held by two hereditary kings and a council of elders. Spartan men were trained from a young age to be soldiers, and the state owned all land and resources. Sparta was famous for its hoplite warriors, who formed the backbone of the Greek city-states' armies in the Persian Wars.

Other notable poleis included Corinth, a major trading center and the site of the first Olympic Games; Thebes, a powerful city-state that rivaled Athens and Sparta; and Argos, one of the oldest and most revered of the Greek city-states.

The poleis of Ancient Greece were an important part of the development of Western civilization, and their legacy can still be seen today in the form of democratic institutions, philosophical and cultural achievements, and the concept of the city-state itself.
