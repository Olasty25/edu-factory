Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts in biological systems. They increase the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the amount of activation energy required for a reaction to occur. Enzymes do this by binding to a substrate, or the reactant that undergoes a chemical reaction, at an active site, which is a pocket on the enzyme that recognizes the substrate. The substrate then undergoes a change in its shape, also known as induced fit, which allows for the reaction to occur.

Allosteric sites are sites on the enzyme that are not involved in catalysis, but instead are involved in the regulation of the enzyme. Allosteric regulators can bind to these sites and either activate or inhibit the enzyme, depending on the shape and charge of the regulator.

Examples of enzymes in the human body include:

* Insulin: an enzyme that helps regulate blood sugar levels by allowing cells to take in glucose.
* Amylase: an enzyme that breaks down starches into sugars in the mouth during digestion.
* Lipase: an enzyme that breaks down fats in the digestive system.
* Pepsin: an enzyme that breaks down proteins in the stomach.
* DNA polymerase: an enzyme that helps replicate DNA during cell division.

Overall, enzymes play a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis in living organisms by allowing for the efficient and controlled chemical reactions to occur.
