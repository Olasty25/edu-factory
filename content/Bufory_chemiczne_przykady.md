# Notatki (Chemical Buffers - Examples)

Buffers are solutions that maintain a stable pH upon the addition of small amounts of an acid or a base. They are essential in various applications, including biochemistry, chemistry, and the food industry.

Some common examples of chemical buffers include:

1. **Phosphoric acid / Sodium phosphate**: This buffer is widely used in biochemistry to maintain a pH of around 7.2. It is composed of a weak acid (phosphoric acid) and its conjugate base (sodium phosphate).
2. **Carbonic acid / Sodium bicarbonate**: This buffer is used in soft drinks to maintain a fizzy taste and prevent spoilage. Carbonic acid is formed when carbon dioxide dissolves in water, and sodium bicarbonate acts as the base.
3. **Sodium bicarbonate / Sodium carbonate**: This buffer is used in swimming pools to prevent corrosion of metal components and protect swimmers' eyes and skin. Sodium bicarbonate acts as the acid, and sodium carbonate acts as the base.
4. **Phosphate buffer (e.g. potassium phosphate monobasic and dipotassium phosphate)**: This buffer is used in biological research to culture cells at a pH of around 7.4. It is composed of a weak acid (phosphoric acid) and its conjugate bases (potassium phosphate monobasic and dipotassium phosphate).
5. **Citric acid / Sodium citrate**: This buffer is used in the food industry to preserve the color and flavor of fruits and vegetables. Citric acid acts as the acid, and sodium citrate acts as the base.

These examples illustrate the importance of buffers in various applications and the role they play in maintaining a stable pH.
