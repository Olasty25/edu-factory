Notes
-----

* Chemical buffers are solutions that resist changes in pH.
* A buffer solution contains equal amounts of an acid and its conjugate base.
* The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.
* Common buffers present in biological systems include phosphate, bicarbonate, and acetate.
* Functions of buffers include regulating pH changes, preventing acidification, and preventing basicity.
* Buffers are essential for the proper functioning of biochemical systems, as they maintain the pH within a narrow range that is optimal for enzyme activity.
* Buffers can be created using a weak acid and its salt or a weak base and its salt.
* Common laboratory buffers include acetate buffer, phosphate buffer, and borate buffer.
* Buffer solutions have limited capacity and can be overwhelmed by large amounts of acids or bases added to them.
* Buffers should be selected based on the desired pH range and the specific requirements of the application.
* Buffers are widely used in laboratory research, diagnostic testing, and biotechnology applications.
* Buffer solutions should be prepared and stored properly to maintain their stability and effectiveness.
