1. Common ratio - a fixed number that is multiplied by each term of a geometric sequence to obtain the next term.
2. Geometric sequence - a sequence of numbers in which each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number.
3. Sum of an infinite geometric sequence - can be found when the common ratio is between -1 and 1, using the formula: Sum = a / (1 - r) where 'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio.
4. nth term of a finite geometric sequence - can be found using the formula: a\_n = a\_1 \* r^(n-1), where 'a\_n' is the nth term, 'a\_1' is the first term, 'r' is the common ratio, and 'n' is the position of the term in the sequence.
5. Sum of a finite geometric sequence - for a sequence with 'n' terms, the formula is: Sum = a\_1 \* (1 - r^n) / (1 - r) where 'a\_1' is the first term, 'r' is the common ratio, 'n' is the number of terms, and r must be between -1 and 1.

In mathematics, a geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number. This number is called the *common ratio*. The common ratio determines the pattern of the sequence, and playing an important role in arithmetic and calculus.

Keep in mind that for a geometric sequence having a common ratio, 'r':

* If |r| < 1, then the sequence converges (sum approaching a limit).
* If |r| > 1, then the sequence diverges (sum grows without bound), or it could be finite depending on a\_1.
* If |r| = 1, then the sequence is constant.

Keep in mind these key formulas when working with geometric sequences:

Sum of a finite geometric sequence (if -1 < r < 1):
Sum = a\_1 \* (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

nth term of a finite geometric sequence:
a\_n = a\_1 \* r^(n-1)

Sum of an infinite geometric sequence (if -1 < r < 1):
Sum = a / (1 - r)

These formulas allow you to:

* Find the sum of a finite or infinite geometric sequence
* Calculate the value of any term in a geometric sequence

Practice with various examples to better familiarize yourself with the differing cases and concepts presented in this topic.
