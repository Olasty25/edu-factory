# Fiszki (41. Scalar Product - Examples)

1. The scalar product of two vectors `u` and `v` is calculated as `u · v = |u| * |v| * cos(θ)`, where `|u|` and `|v|` are the magnitudes of the vectors and `θ` is the angle between them.
2. If the scalar product of two vectors is zero, it means that the vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular) or one of them is the zero vector.
3. The scalar product of two vectors in a 3D space can be calculated using the formula `u · v = u1*v1 + u2*v2 + u3*v3`, where `u = (u1, u2, u3)` and `v = (v1, v2, v3)`.
4. The scalar product is commutative, i.e., `u · v = v · u`.
5. The scalar product can be used to find the angle between two vectors with the formula `cos(θ) = (u · v) / (|u| * |v|)`.

# Notatki (41. Scalar Product - Examples)

The scalar product, also known as the dot product, is a mathematical operation that takes two vectors and returns a scalar value. It is calculated as the product of the magnitudes of the vectors and the cosine of the angle between them. In a coordinate system, the scalar product can be calculated using the formula `u · v = u1*v1 + u2*v2 + u3*v3` for 3D vectors.

The scalar product has several important properties, such as being commutative (`u · v = v · u`), distributive over addition (`u · (v + w) = u · v + u · w`), and associative with scalar multiplication (`a(u · v) = au · v = u · av`).

The scalar product can be used to determine if two vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular) by checking if their scalar product is zero. Additionally, the scalar product can be used to find the angle between two vectors using the formula `cos(θ) = (u · v) / (|u| * |v|)`.

When solving problems involving the scalar product, it is important to carefully identify the components of the vectors and apply the formula correctly. Practice and familiarity with the concept will help in solving more complex problems and understanding its applications in various fields, such as physics and engineering.
