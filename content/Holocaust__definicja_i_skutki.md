# Notes: Holocaust - Definition and Consequences

The Holocaust is a term used to describe the systematic persecution and extermination of Jews and other minorities by the Nazi Party in Germany during World War II. The Nazi Party targeted various groups, including Jews, homosexuals, Romani, disabled individuals, and political opponents, for persecution and extermination. The "Final Solution," a proposal to exterminate all Jews and other undesirable groups, was implemented during this time.

The Holocaust lasted from 1933 to 1945 and resulted in the deaths of an estimated six million Jews and millions of others. The Nazis used concentration camps, gas chambers, and other means to carry out the extermination.

The long-term consequences of the Holocaust include the establishment of the state of Israel, the Nuremberg Trials to prosecute Nazi leaders, and the division of Germany. The Holocaust also had a profound impact on the world, leading to increased awareness and recognition of human rights and the importance of preventing genocide. It is essential to remember and learn from the atrocities of the Holocaust to ensure that such events never occur again.
