Notes
-----

Renewable fuels, also known as alternative fuels, are energy sources that can be replenished naturally and used in place of fossil fuels. There are many types of renewable fuels, but some of the most common are biodiesel, ethanol, hydrogen, methanol, and biogas.

Biodiesel is a fuel made from animal fat or vegetable oil. It can be used in a standard diesel engine, but it must be mixed with petroleum diesel to prevent it from solidifying in cold temperatures. Biodiesel can be made from a variety of feedstocks, including soybean oil, recycled cooking oil, and waste vegetable oil.

Ethanol is a fuel made from corn, sugarcane, or other plants. It is commonly used as a gasoline additive to increase the octane rating of gasoline and reduce carbon monoxide emissions. Ethanol can also be used as a fuel in its own right, but it must be used in a modified engine to prevent damage caused by its corrosiveness.

Hydrogen is a fuel that can be used in a fuel cell to produce electricity. Hydrogen is a clean-burning fuel, producing only water as a byproduct, but it is not found in its pure form in nature. Hydrogen can be produced from a variety of sources, including natural gas, water, and biomass.

Methanol is a fuel made from wood, natural gas, or coal. It can be used as a fuel in some internal combustion engines, but it is not as commonly used as other renewable fuels. Methanol is toxic and can be fatal if ingested, and it must be handled with care.

Biogas is a fuel made from the anaerobic digestion of organic matter, such as food waste, sewage, or manure. Biogas consists mainly of methane and carbon dioxide, and it can be used as a fuel in its own right or converted into biomethane, which can be used as a substitute for natural gas. Biogas is a renewable and sustainable energy source, and it can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
