### Notatki

The human digestive system is a complex series of organs and glands that process food. The main organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas.

The process of digestion begins in the mouth, where food is chewed and broken down by enzymes in saliva. The food then travels down the esophagus and into the stomach, where it is further broken down by stomach acid and enzymes. The stomach slowly empties its contents into the small intestine, where the majority of nutrient absorption occurs. The walls of the small intestine are lined with finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption.

The large intestine is responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes from undigested food and preparing it for elimination. The large intestine consists of the colon, rectum, and anus. The colon is the longest part of the large intestine and is responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes. The rectum is a short, wide tube that connects the colon to the anus, which is the opening through which feces are eliminated from the body.

The liver, gallbladder, and pancreas are accessory organs that play a vital role in digestion. The liver produces bile, which aids in the digestion of fats. The gallbladder stores bile and releases it into the small intestine when needed. The pancreas produces digestive enzymes that are released into the small intestine to help break down food.

In summary, the human digestive system is a complex system that works together to process and absorb nutrients from food, and eliminate waste.
