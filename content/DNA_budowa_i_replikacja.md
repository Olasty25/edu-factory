# Fiszki - DNA Structure and Replication

1. The structure of DNA is a double helix, which consists of two sugar-phosphate backbones twisted together and held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs.
2. Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA, each containing a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.
3. There are four nitrogenous bases in DNA: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T).
4. The enzymes involved in DNA replication include helicase, primase, polymerase, and ligase.
5. Semiconservative replication is the mechanism by which DNA replicates, creating two identical daughter molecules, each consisting of one original strand and one newly synthesized strand.

# Notatki - DNA Structure and Replication

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the genetic material found in all living organisms. It is a long, twisted molecule that consists of two sugar-phosphate backbones held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs. The four nitrogenous bases found in DNA are Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T). These bases pair up with each other in a specific way, with A always pairing with T and C always pairing with G.

DNA replication is the process by which DNA makes an identical copy of itself. This is necessary for cell division and for passing genetic information on to the next generation. The process of DNA replication is semiconservative, which means that each daughter molecule contains one original strand and one newly synthesized strand.

The enzymes involved in DNA replication include helicase, which unwinds the DNA double helix; primase, which adds short RNA primers to the new strands; polymerase, which adds nucleotides to the new strands; and ligase, which seals any gaps in the new strands. The process of DNA replication is highly accurate, with multiple mechanisms in place to ensure that the new strands are an exact copy of the original strand. However, mistakes can still occur, leading to mutations. These mutations can have a wide range of effects on the organism, depending on where they occur and whether they affect the function of essential genes.
