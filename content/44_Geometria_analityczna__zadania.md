# Notatki: Geometria Analityczna

Geometria analityczna is the study of geometry using coordinates. This allows for the application of algebraic methods to geometric problems, leading to a more straightforward analysis.

There are several key terms and concepts in geometria analityczna, including:

- **Distance**: Calculating the distance between two points involves using the distance formula, which is based on the Pythagorean theorem.
- **Slope**: The slope of a line describes its steepness and direction, and is calculated using the slope formula.
- **Point-slope form**: Point-slope form is used to determine the equation of a line when given a point and a slope.
- **Parallel lines**: Two lines are parallel if they have the same slope.
- **Vertical and horizontal lines**: A horizontal line has a slope of 0, while the slope of a vertical line is undefined.
