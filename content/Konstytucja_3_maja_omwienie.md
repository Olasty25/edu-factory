# Notatki

The Constitution of 3 May was a groundbreaking political document that marked a turning point in the history of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Adopted on 3 May 1791 in Warsaw, it was the second oldest constitution in the world after the United States Constitution.

The Constitution of 3 May was drafted by a group of enlightened deputies to the Four-Year Sejm, including Hugo Kołłątaj, Stanisław Staszic, and Scipione Piattoli. It aimed to strengthen the central government, reduce the influence of the nobility, and abolish the liberum veto, which had paralyzed the Sejm for decades.

The Constitution of 3 May guaranteed equal rights and freedoms to all citizens, regardless of their social status, and established a constitutional monarchy and a bicameral legislature. It also introduced a system of taxation, a modern army, and a network of schools and universities.

Despite its progressive nature, the Constitution of 3 May was opposed by Poland's neighbors, including Russia, Prussia, and Austria, who feared its potential to create a strong and independent Polish state. In 1792, Russia and Prussia invaded Poland and forced the Sejm to annul the Constitution of 3 May, leading to the final partition of Poland and its disappearance from the map of Europe for more than a century.

In conclusion, the Constitution of 3 May was a remarkable political achievement that reflected the advanced nature of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and its enlightened elites. However, its failure to garner support from Poland's neighbors and to overcome internal divisions and conflicts ultimately sealed its fate and contributed to the downfall of the Polish state. Nevertheless, the legacy of the Constitution of 3 May continues to inspire and inform contemporary debates about constitutionalism, democracy, and human rights in Poland and beyond.
