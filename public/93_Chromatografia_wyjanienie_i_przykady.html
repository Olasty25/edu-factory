<h2>Notatki</h2>
<p>Chromatography is a technique used to separate and analyze mixtures. It works by passing a mixture through a medium, called the stationary phase, while a second substance, called the mobile phase, moves through the stationary phase and carries the mixture with it. The different components of the mixture will have different rates of movement through the stationary phase, causing them to separate from one another.</p>
<p>There are several different types of chromatography, including paper chromatography, gas chromatography, and liquid chromatography. Paper chromatography uses paper as the stationary phase, while gas chromatography uses a gas as the mobile phase. Liquid chromatography, on the other hand, uses a liquid as the mobile phase.</p>
<p>The stationary phase is the substance that remains still during the chromatography process. It can be a solid or a liquid, and it serves to separate the components of the mixture as they move through it. The mobile phase, on the other hand, is the substance that moves through the stationary phase, carrying the sample with it. It can be a gas, a liquid, or a supercritical fluid.</p>
<p>Chromatography has many different applications. It can be used to separate a mixture of pigments from a plant, to measure the concentration of a specific ion in a solution, or to identify the elements present in a sample. It is a valuable tool in many fields, including chemistry, biology, and forensics.</p>
