<p>Medallions, also known as meditation or Holy Sonnets, are a series of 16 sonnets written by the English poet John Donne. These poems are primarily concerned with the relationship between the poet and his beloved, and often explore themes of love, sorrow, and mortality.</p>
<p>Each medallion sonnet is comprised of two parts: a quatrain and a couplet. The quatrain typically introduces a theme or idea, while the couplet serves to resolve or expand upon the ideas presented in the quatrain.</p>

<p>One of Donne&#39;s most famous lines, &quot;No man is an island,&quot; comes from his Medallion Sonnet X. The line is often used to express the interconnectedness of all people and the importance of community and support in times of hardship.</p>
<p>Overall, the medallion sonnets serve as a powerful expression of Donne&#39;s unique poetic voice and his ability to explore complex emotions and philosophical ideas in a concise and powerful way.</p>
