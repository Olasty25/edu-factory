<h2>Notatki</h2>
<p>Medallions are a type of pendant, often made of precious metals such as gold or silver and decorated with a picture or design on one or both sides. They have been worn throughout history as a form of personal adornment, and are often used to signify membership in a club or organization or to commemorate a special event or achievement.</p>
<p>One of the earliest cultures to use medallions as a form of jewelry was the Roman Empire. Large decorative medallions, known as phalerae, were often worn by nobles as a symbol of their rank and status. These medallions were often made of precious metals and decorated with intricate designs and images.</p>
<p>In modern times, medallions continue to be a popular form of jewelry. They are often given as gifts to commemorate a special achievement or milestone, such as a graduation or retirement. Medallions may also be used as symbols of membership in a club or organization, and are often worn by members of fraternal organizations and other groups.</p>
<p>There are many different materials that can be used to make medallions, including gold, silver, bronze, and even glass. The choice of material will often depend on the intended use and appearance of the medallion. For example, a medallion that is meant to be worn as a piece of jewelry may be made of a more precious metal, such as gold or silver, while a medallion that is meant to be displayed as a decoration may be made of a less expensive material, such as bronze.</p>
<p>Overall, medallions are a timeless and versatile form of jewelry that can be used to commemorate a special occasion, symbolize membership in a group, or simply add a touch of elegance to an outfit. Whether made of precious metals or more humble materials, medallions have been a popular choice for personal adornment for centuries and continue to be a cherished possession for many people today.</p>
