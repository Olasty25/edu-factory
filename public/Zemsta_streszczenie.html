<h1>Notes: Zemsta – Understanding the Film</h1>
<p>&quot;Revenge&quot; (2017) is a French action thriller directed by Coralie Fargeat. The movie follows the story of Jen, a young woman who goes on a retreat to a desert villa with her wealthy boyfriend Richard and his friends. However, the retreat takes a dark turn when Richard betrays Jen and is involved in her attempted murder.</p>
<p>The film is a commentary on gender dynamics and the objectification of women in film and society. Jen is presented as an object of desire for the male characters, who view her as a plaything rather than a person. This is exemplified in a scene where Richard&#39;s friends watch Jen skinny dipping through a telescope.</p>
<p>Jen&#39;s revenge against her oppressors is portrayed as a journey of self-discovery, as she transforms from a vulnerable victim to a fierce survivor. The film&#39;s graphic violence and gore serve to highlight the brutality of the male characters&#39; actions towards Jen and the consequences of their betrayal.</p>
<p>The cinematography and setting of the film also play a significant role in creating a distinct atmosphere. The desert landscape is used to emphasize Jen&#39;s isolation and vulnerability, while the use of bright colors and wide shots highlight the beauty of the natural environment.</p>
<p>Overall, &quot;Revenge&quot; is a powerful and thought-provoking film that challenges traditional gender dynamics and offers a fresh perspective on the revenge genre. It is a must-watch for fans of action, thriller, and horror films.</p>
