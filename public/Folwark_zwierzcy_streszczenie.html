<h2>Notatki</h2>
<p>&quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell is a political allegory that tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer, Mr. Jones, in the hope of creating a society where the animals can be equal, free, and happy. The story follows the animals&#39; attempts to create this utopia, and the challenges and setbacks they face along the way.</p>
<p>The main character in the story is Boxer, a strong and hardworking horse who is deeply committed to the ideals of the rebellion. He is a symbol of the working class and is often taken advantage of by the pigs, who are the leaders of the rebellion.</p>
<p>The original leader of the rebellion is Snowball, a pig who is intelligent and charismatic. He has a clear vision for the future of Animal Farm and is able to articulate it in a way that inspires the other animals. However, he is eventually driven off the farm by Napoleon, another pig who seizes power and becomes a dictator.</p>
<p>Napoleon uses propaganda and fear to maintain his power and control over the other animals. He manipulates the animals into believing that he is their savior and that his decisions are always right. The animals are worked to the bone and are barely able to feed themselves, but they are too afraid of Napoleon to speak out.</p>
<p>The story ends with the animals living in a state of despair and hopelessness, having lost the ideals that they fought so hard for in the rebellion. The farm has been renamed &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and is now just like any other farm, with the pigs living in luxury while the other animals work hard for little reward.</p>
<p>Orwell&#39;s story is a powerful critique of totalitarianism and the ways in which political leaders can manipulate and control their followers through propaganda and fear. It serves as a warning about the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of maintaining one&#39;s ideals and values, even in the face of adversity.</p>
