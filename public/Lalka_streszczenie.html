<li>Short Notes</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;The Doll&quot; by Bolesław Prus is a novel about a young man named Witołd, who falls in love with a woman named Izabela. However, their love is complicated by the fact that Izabela is from a higher social class than Witołd, and he is uncertain whether she will return his affections.</p>
<p>The novel is set in 19th century Poland, and it explores themes of class, power, and the role of women in society. It is named &quot;The Doll&quot; because a doll played by the protagonist&#39;s cousin, who is also named Izabela, serves as a symbol of the protagonist&#39;s idealized vision of the woman he loves.</p>
<p>The protagonist, Witołd, is a young man who is intelligent and sensitive, but he is also naive and idealistic. He is infatuated with Izabela, and he is willing to do anything to win her heart. However, he often misunderstands her motives and actions, and this leads to misunderstandings and conflicts.</p>
<p>Izabela, the object of Witołd&#39;s affections, is a complex character who is both admired and criticized in the novel. She is praised for her beauty and grace, but she is also criticized for her superficiality and her obsession with social status. She is a woman who is caught between two worlds: the traditional, patriarchal society of 19th century Poland, and the modern, liberal ideas that are beginning to emerge.</p>
<p>The novel also features a number of other interesting characters, including the protagonist&#39;s tutor, who gives him a doll named Ewa, and Stanisław Wokulski, a successful merchant who is also in love with Izabela. Through these characters, the novel explores themes of love, class, and the role of women in society.</p>
<p>In conclusion, &quot;The Doll&quot; is a complex and thought-provoking novel that offers a rich, multilayered portrait of 19th century Poland, and the social, political, and cultural issues that shaped the era. It is a novel that challenges readers to think deeply about the nature of love, the role of women, and the impact of social class on our lives and relationships.</p>
