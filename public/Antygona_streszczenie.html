<p>&quot;Antigone&quot; is a tragedy by the ancient Greek playwright Sophocles, written around 441 BC. The play tells the story of Antigone, the daughter of Oedipus, king of Thebes. When Oedipus&#39; sons, Eteocles and Polyneices, kill each other in a battle for the throne, their uncle Creon becomes the new ruler of Thebes. Creon decrees that Eteocles will be honored with a proper burial, while the body of Polyneices will be left outside the city walls to be eaten by animals, as a warning against treason.</p>
<p>Antigone defies Creon&#39;s order and tries to bury her brother, considering it to be her duty as a sister and a religious obligation. She believes that divine laws, which require her to bury her brother, take precedence over human laws made by Creon. Antigone is caught, and Creon pronounces the death penalty for her.</p>
<p>The play explores the conflict between divine law and human law and the tragic consequences of this conflict for both Antigone and Creon. Antigone&#39;s unwavering commitment to her principles and her refusal to compromise her beliefs lead to her death, while Creon&#39;s stubbornness results in the loss of his son and his wife, as well as the downfall of his rule.</p>
<p>&quot;Antigone&quot; is a powerful exploration of the themes of morality, ethics, and the limits of human authority, making it one of the most enduring and thought-provoking plays in Western literature.</p>
