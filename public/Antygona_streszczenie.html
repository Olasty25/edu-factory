<p><strong>Short Summary:</strong></p>
<p>In the play Antigone by Sophocles, Antigone is the daughter of Oedipus and Jocasta, and the sister of Polynices. After the Theban Civil War between Polynices and Eteocles, Creon becomes the king of Thebes and forbids the burial of Polynices, considering him a traitor. However, Antigone defies Creon&#39;s decree and buries her brother, arguing that the gods&#39; laws are greater than man&#39;s laws. Creon condemns Antigone to death, and she hangs herself in the tomb. Haemon, Creon&#39;s son and Antigone&#39;s fiancé, kills himself upon finding Antigone&#39;s body, and Eurydice, Creon&#39;s wife, also kills herself upon hearing of Haemon&#39;s death. The play is a tragedy that explores the conflict between the individual and society as well as the inevitability of fate and the tragic flaws of its characters.</p>
