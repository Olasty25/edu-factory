<li><p>Sinus (sin) and cosinus (cos) are trigonometric functions used to describe the ratios of the sides of a right-angled triangle in relation to its angles.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sin(x) is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle x to the length of the hypotenuse.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cos(x) is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The values of sin and cos repeat every 360 degrees (2π radians) due to the periodicity of the functions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The range of the sin function is from -1 to 1.</p>
</li>

<h2>Notatki</h2>
<p>Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles. Sinus and cosinus are two of the most important trigonometric functions. They are defined as ratios of the sides of a right-angled triangle with respect to its angles. The sin function returns the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse, while the cos function returns the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.</p>
<p>The sinus and cosinus functions have a periodicity of 360 degrees (2π radians), which means that their values repeat every 360 degrees. Additionally, the values of sin and cos range from -1 to 1. The sine function is an odd function, which means that sin(-x) = -sin(x), while the cos function is an even function, which means that cos(-x) = cos(x).</p>
<p>Sinus and cosinus functions are widely used in mathematics and physics, including solving equations, calculating lengths and areas, and describing wave motion, such as sound and light waves. Understanding these functions is essential for further studies in mathematics and engineering.</p>
