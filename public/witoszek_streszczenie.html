<h2>Notatki</h2>
<p>Tartuffe, the main character of the play, is a hypocritical religious fraud who pretends to be a holy man. He infiltrates the household of Orgon, a wealthy man who is easily manipulated by Tartuffe&#39;s false piety. Despite his family&#39;s warnings, Orgon remains blind to Tartuffe&#39;s true nature and starts to trust him more and more.</p>
<p>Elmire, Orgon&#39;s second wife, is aware of Tartuffe&#39;s deceit and tries to expose him. She devises a plan to trap Tartuffe into confessing his true intentions, which eventually leads Orgon to see Tartuffe for who he really is.</p>
<p>Pernelle, Orgon&#39;s mother, initially supports Tartuffe, but her views change throughout the play. She eventually becomes convinced of Tartuffe&#39;s deceit and helps Orgon and his family expel him from the household.</p>
<p>Dorine, a servant in the household, is also aware of Tartuffe&#39;s deceit and tries to expose him. She provides comedic relief throughout the play, often mocking Tartuffe&#39;s false piety and hypocrisy.</p>
<p>The play ends with Tartuffe&#39;s deceit exposed, and he is expelled from the household. Orgon learns a valuable lesson about trust and the importance of listening to those around him. The play is a commentary on the dangers of hypocrisy and the power of truth and honesty.</p>
