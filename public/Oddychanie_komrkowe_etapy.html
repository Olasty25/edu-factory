          <h1> Cellular Respiration Stages</h1>
<p>In this educational material, we will explore the different stages of cellular respiration. This process is crucial for generating energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) in cells. Cellular respiration occurs in three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain.</p>

<h2>Fiszki</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Glycolysis</strong>: This is the first stage of cellular respiration that occurs in the cytoplasm. It consists of several reactions, which break down glucose, forming two molecules of pyruvate, ATP, NADH, and water.</li>
<li><strong>Link reaction</strong>: After glycolysis, pyruvate is converted into acetyl CoA, forming one molecule of NADH in a process called the link reaction.</li>
<li><strong>Citric acid cycle</strong>: The citric acid cycle is a series of reactions that occur in the mitochondrial matrix. It involves the conversion of acetyl CoA into two molecules of carbon dioxide, producing ATP, NADH, FADH2, and water.</li>
<li><strong>Electron transport chain</strong>: The last stage of cellular respiration takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Here, high-energy electrons pass through complexes, driving the creation of a proton gradient, which ultimately leads to ATP synthesis through chemiosmosis.</li>
<li><strong>Anaerobic respiration</strong>: In some organisms, when oxygen levels are low, they can still produce ATP through a process called anaerobic respiration or fermentation, examples include lactic acid and alcohol fermentation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Cellular respiration is a vital process in which cells generate energy through the oxidation of organic nutrients. It can be separated into four stages: glycolysis, the link reaction, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain.</p>
<p>Glycolysis (C6H12O6 + 2NAD+ + 2ADP + 2P_i ⇒ 2Pyruvate + 2NADH + 2ATP + 2H2O + 2H+) is the first and anaerobic phase of cellular respiration, taking place in the cytoplasm, that splits a glucose molecule into two pyruvates, releasing energy in the form of ATP, NADH and water. After glycolysis, each pyruvate is transported into the mitochondria and enters the linked reactions (converting pyruvate into acetyl CoA).</p>
<p>The citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle) starts with acetyl CoA, which undergoes a series of chemical reactions in the mitochondrial matrix, creating ATP, NADH, FADH2, and carbon dioxide. The citric acid cycle serves multiple purposes, such as the complete oxidation of acetyl CoA, providing reducing equivalents for the electron transport chain, and producing NADH, FADH2, GTP, and ATP.</p>
<p>The electron transport chain is the fourth and final stage of cellular respiration. In this stage, high-energy electrons pass through several complexes (Complex I, II, III, and IV) along the inner mitochondrial membrane, reducing oxygen to form water. Additionally, protons are pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane, forming an electrochemical gradient. Chemiosmosis occurs as protons flow back down their gradient, generating ATP.</p>
<p>Although most cells primarily depend on cellular respiration to generate ATP and reduce nutrients, alternative pathways have evolved to accommodate anaerobic conditions. Fermentation is one example of an anaerobic process, used by some organisms to preserve ATP production during reduced oxygen availability. Common fermentations include lactic acid fermentation (used in muscles) and alcohol fermentation (observable in yeast).</p>
<p>Cellular respiration plays a critical role in sustaining life and energy transformation in various organisms. Its four major stages—glycolysis, link reaction, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain— demonstrate a complex and efficient mechanism to transfer chemical energy and support growth, replication, and various cellular functions.</p>
