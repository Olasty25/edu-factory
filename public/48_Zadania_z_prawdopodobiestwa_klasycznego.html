<li>Classical Probability: A branch of mathematics that deals with the study of likelihood or chance of occurrence of an event.</li>
<li>Equally Likely Outcomes: Outcomes that have the same probability of occurrence.</li>
<li>Favorable Outcomes: The outcomes that we desire or are interested in.</li>
<li>Possible Outcomes: The total number of outcomes that can occur.</li>
<li>Probability: A mathematical measurement that reflects the chance or likelihood of an event to occur.</li>

<h1>Notatki (Classical Probability)</h1>
<p>Classical probability, also known as a priori probability or theoretical probability, is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of likelihood or chance of occurrence of an event. It is based on the assumption of equally likely outcomes. The probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.</p>
<p>Probability is a numerical value that ranges between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates an impossible event, and 1 indicates a certain event. An event with a probability of 0.5 is considered fairly likely to occur, while an event with a probability of 0.2 is considered unlikely.</p>
<p>When calculating classical probability, it is important to ensure that all possible outcomes are accounted for and that each outcome is equally likely to occur. If an outcome is not equally likely to occur, or if some outcomes have been overlooked, then the calculated probability will be incorrect.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how to calculate classical probability:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a fair coin is tossed, there are two possible outcomes: heads or tails. The probability of getting heads is therefore 1/2.</li>
<li>If a fair die is rolled, there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The probability of getting an even number is therefore 3/6 or 1/2.</li>
<li>If a card is drawn at random from a well-shuffled deck of 52 playing cards, there are 52 possible outcomes. If we are interested in the probability of drawing a spade, there are 13 favorable outcomes, and the probability is therefore 13/52 or 1/4.</li>
<li>If two coins are tossed simultaneously, there are four possible outcomes: heads-heads, heads-tails, tails-heads, or tails-tails. The probability of getting at least one head is therefore 3/4.</li>
</ul>
<p>Classical probability is an important concept in mathematics and has many applications in fields such as finance, engineering, and physics. It helps us understand the likelihood of different outcomes and make more informed decisions based on this understanding. By understanding the basics of classical probability, we can better understand the world around us and make more accurate predictions.</p>
