<h1>Notes (~200 Words)</h1>
<p>Genetic mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a gene or chromosome. These changes can be caused by a variety of factors, including errors in DNA replication, exposure to mutagenic chemicals or radiation, and viral infections. Mutations can also occur spontaneously due to errors in the proofreading and repair mechanisms that cells use to maintain the integrity of their DNA.</p>
<p>There are two main types of genetic mutations: point mutations and frameshift mutations. Point mutations result from a change in a single nucleotide in a DNA sequence, while frameshift mutations result from the addition or deletion of nucleotides in a DNA sequence. Point mutations can be further classified as missing, insertion, or substitution. Frameshift mutations can lead to the creation of stop codons, which can cause the production of truncated or nonfunctional proteins.</p>
<p>Another type of genetic mutation is a genetic mosaicism, which occurs when an individual has two or more different genotypes in their cells. This can happen when a mutation occurs during embryonic development and is not present in all of an individual&#39;s cells. Genetic mosaicism can also occur as a result of chimerism, where an individual has cells from two different zygotes, or as a result of a genetic mutation occurring in a single cell that then divides and forms a tissue or organ.</p>
<p>Germline mutations are genetic mutations that occur in the germ cells (sperm or egg cells) and can be passed down to offspring. Somatic mutations, on the other hand, occur in the body&#39;s non-reproductive cells and cannot be passed down to offspring.</p>
<p>It&#39;s important to note that not all genetic mutations are harmful. Some mutations can even be beneficial and can lead to evolutionary adaptation. However, some mutations can cause genetic disorders, cancer, and other diseases. Understanding the different types of genetic mutations and how they occur can help in the development of treatments and therapies for genetic disorders.</p>
