<h1>Tango Summarized - Notes</h1>
<p>Tango is a dance and music style that originated in the late 19th century, primarily in the working-class neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The dance is characterized by its passionate and dramatic movements, while the music features expressive and melancholic melodies, often structured in binary phrases and utilizing chromatic harmonies.</p>
<p>The dance and music of tango gained popularity in Europe during the early 20th century, especially in France. This led to the development of various styles and orchestrations of tango music, with some bands favoring a more classical approach and others incorporating elements of jazz and other genres.</p>
<p>Astor Piazzolla is one of the most famous tango composers and musicians, known for his influential &quot;Tango Nuevo&quot; movement, which emerged in the 1990s. Tango Nuevo combined traditional tango with elements from classical music and jazz, resulting in a more complex and varied sound. Piazzolla&#39;s works have been influential in the popularization of tango around the world.</p>
<p>There are various tango dance styles, but Tango Escenario is the one typically seen in international competitions. Tango Escenario evolved from traditional tango to incorporate more dramatic and choreographed movements, while still retaining the passionate nature of the original dance. In contrast, Tango Milonguero is a close-embrace style of tango, designed for social dancing in small spaces, whereas Tango de Salón is more fluid and less codified, allowing for greater self-expression.</p>
<p>Tango remains a powerful and influential dance and music genre, known for its emotional intensity and lasting appeal. Its various iterations and adaptations over the past century have allowed it to maintain its relevance and reach new audiences, while still paying homage to its rich history and roots.</p>
