<h2>Notatki</h2>
<p>A biome is a large, naturally occurring community of plants and animals that occupy a distinct region. Biomes are defined by factors such as climate, topography, and geography. There are several different types of biomes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tropical Rainforest</strong>: These biomes are found near the equator and are characterized by tall trees, high rainfall, and a warm climate. They are home to a diverse array of plant and animal species, many of which are not found anywhere else in the world.</li>
<li><strong>Tundra</strong>: Tundra biomes are found in cold, dry climates and are characterized by low shrubs and grasses. These biomes are extremely cold, with temperatures that can drop below -50 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
<li><strong>Temperate Grassland</strong>: These biomes are found in areas with moderate temperatures and rainfall, and are characterized by tall grasses. They are home to a variety of plant and animal species, including bison, prairie dogs, and antelope.</li>
<li><strong>Mediterranean Forest</strong>: Mediterranean forests are found in areas with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. They are characterized by evergreen trees and shrubs, such as oak and olive trees.</li>
<li><strong>Temperate Rainforest</strong>: These biomes are found in areas with high rainfall and cool temperatures, and are characterized by coniferous trees. They are home to a variety of plant and animal species, including salmon, bears, and eagles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other types of biomes include deserts, temperate deciduous forests, and tropical dry forests. Each biome has its own unique characteristics and is home to a distinct community of plants and animals. Understanding biomes is important for understanding the natural world and the ways in which different ecosystems function.</p>
