<p><strong>Notatki</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Balladyna&quot; is a play by Juliusz Slowacki, a Polish Romantic poet and playwright. The play tells the story of Balladyna, a young woman who is driven by ambition and a desire for power. At the beginning of the play, Balladyna is portrayed as innocent and pure, but as the story progresses, she becomes more and more ruthless in her pursuit of the throne.</p>
<p>Throughout the play, Balladyna manipulates those around her, including her own sister Alina, in order to achieve her goals. She marries Grzes in a scheme to become queen, but ultimately rejects him in favor of Kirkor, a wealthy landowner. In the end, however, Balladyna&#39;s schemes are unsuccessful, and she is ultimately killed by the ghost of her former lover, Viktor.</p>
<p>&quot;Balladyna&quot; is a classic tale of ambition and its consequences, and serves as a warning about the dangers of allowing one&#39;s desire for power to consume them. The play is also notable for its exploration of themes such as fate, free will, and the supernatural. Slowacki&#39;s use of poetry and symbolism adds depth and richness to the story, making &quot;Balladyna&quot; a truly unique and compelling work of literature.</p>
