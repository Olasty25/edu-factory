<h2>Notatki</h2>
<p>Mitosis is the process of cell division that results in two daughter cells each having the same number and kind of chromosomes as the parent nucleus. It is a fundamental process for growth, development, and repair in multicellular organisms. The stages of mitosis include prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, followed by cytokinesis, which divides the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>Meiosis, on the other hand, is the process of cell division that results in the production of four genetically unique daughter cells. This type of cell division is necessary for sexual reproduction, as it results in the creation of gametes or sex cells (sperm and egg cells). Meiosis consists of two rounds of cell division, meiosis I and meiosis II, each including the stages of prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The critical difference between mitosis and meiosis is that meiosis results in cells with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell, allowing for genetic diversity in offspring.</p>
<p>The stages of mitosis and meiosis are similar, but there are some critical differences. For example, in mitosis, the cell divides once, creating two genetically identical daughter cells. In meiosis, the cell divides twice, creating four genetically unique daughter cells. Additionally, during meiosis, the homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic material through a process called crossing over, which further increases genetic diversity.</p>
<p>In summary, mitosis and meiosis are essential processes for growth, development, and reproduction. While mitosis results in genetically identical daughter cells, meiosis creates genetically unique gametes, allowing for genetic diversity in offspring. Understanding these processes is critical to understanding how organisms grow, develop, and reproduce.</p>
