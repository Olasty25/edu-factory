<h2>Notes</h2>
<p><strong>Mitosis</strong> and <strong>meiosis</strong> are two types of cell division that are essential for growth, development, and reproduction. The main goal of mitosis is to create genetically identical cells, while the purpose of meiosis is to create gametes, or sex cells, that can combine during fertilization to create a new organism with a unique genetic makeup.</p>
<p>Mitosis is a part of the cell cycle and consists of four main phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. In prophase, chromosomes condense and become visible, and the nuclear membrane begins to break down. During metaphase, chromosomes align at the metaphase plate, an imaginary line that runs through the center of the cell. In anaphase, sister chromatids separate and move to opposite ends of the cell. Finally, in telophase, nuclear membranes reform around the separated chromosomes, and the cell begins to divide.</p>
<p>Meiosis is a more complex process that consists of two rounds of cell division. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair up and cross over, exchanging genetic material. The cell then divides into two daughter cells, each containing a set of 23 chromosomes. During meiosis II, the sister chromatids separate, forming four haploid gametes, or sex cells. Crossing over allows for genetic diversity, which is essential for the survival and evolution of a species.</p>
<p>Both mitosis and meiosis are critical for the survival of organisms. Mitosis allows for the growth and repair of tissues, while meiosis enables sexual reproduction and genetic diversity. Understanding the differences and similarities between these two processes is essential for a comprehensive understanding of cell biology.</p>
