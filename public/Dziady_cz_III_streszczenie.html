<p><strong>Krótkie notatki</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Dziady&quot; Part III is a drama by Adam Mickiewicz, written in 1820-1821. The main character of the drama is Gustaw, a romantic hero, who falls in love with a maid, Zosia. Gustaw has a double, Konrad, who represents the opposite aspect of Gustaw&#39;s personality. He is sick and tormented, and his death in Act IV symbolizes the end of Gustaw&#39;s romantic illusions.</p>
<p>The drama is full of symbols, such as the albatross worn by Gustaw, which symbolizes the burden of life and creativity. The act of throwing the albatross into the water by Konrad symbolizes the rejection of the burden of life.</p>
<p>Gu Ładoś, a publisher and printer, is a friend of Gustaw and helps him to publish his poems. He represents the practical aspect of life, which is in contrast to Gustaw&#39;s romanticism.</p>
<p>The drama is divided into four acts, and each act presents a different aspect of Gustaw&#39;s personality. The first act introduces Gustaw and his love for Zosia, the second act presents Gustaw&#39;s doubts and fears, the third act shows Gustaw&#39;s decision to kill himself, and the fourth act depicts the death of Konrad and the end of Gustaw&#39;s romantic illusions.</p>
<p>Overall, &quot;Dziady&quot; Part III is a rich and complex drama that explores the relationship between art and reality, life and death, and the burden of creativity.</p>
