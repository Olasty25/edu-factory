<li>Common ratio - a fixed number that is multiplied by each term of a geometric sequence to obtain the next term.</li>
<li>Geometric sequence - a sequence of numbers in which each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number.</li>
<li>Sum of an infinite geometric sequence - can be found when the common ratio is between -1 and 1, using the formula: Sum = a / (1 - r) where &#39;a&#39; is the first term and &#39;r&#39; is the common ratio.</li>
<li>nth term of a finite geometric sequence - can be found using the formula: a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1), where &#39;a_n&#39; is the nth term, &#39;a_1&#39; is the first term, &#39;r&#39; is the common ratio, and &#39;n&#39; is the position of the term in the sequence.</li>
<li>Sum of a finite geometric sequence - for a sequence with &#39;n&#39; terms, the formula is: Sum = a_1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r) where &#39;a_1&#39; is the first term, &#39;r&#39; is the common ratio, &#39;n&#39; is the number of terms, and r must be between -1 and 1.</li>

<h1>Ciąg geometryczny - Notatki</h1>
<p>In mathematics, a geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number. This number is called the <em>common ratio</em>. The common ratio determines the pattern of the sequence, and playing an important role in arithmetic and calculus.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for a geometric sequence having a common ratio, &#39;r&#39;:</p>
<ul>
<li>If |r| &lt; 1, then the sequence converges (sum approaching a limit).</li>
<li>If |r| &gt; 1, then the sequence diverges (sum grows without bound), or it could be finite depending on a_1.</li>
<li>If |r| = 1, then the sequence is constant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind these key formulas when working with geometric sequences:</p>
<p>Sum of a finite geometric sequence (if -1 &lt; r &lt; 1):
Sum = a_1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)</p>
<p>nth term of a finite geometric sequence:
a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1)</p>
<p>Sum of an infinite geometric sequence (if -1 &lt; r &lt; 1):
Sum = a / (1 - r)</p>
<p>These formulas allow you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the sum of a finite or infinite geometric sequence</li>
<li>Calculate the value of any term in a geometric sequence</li>
</ul>
<p>Practice with various examples to better familiarize yourself with the differing cases and concepts presented in this topic.</p>
