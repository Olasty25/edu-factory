<h1>Notes: Processes of Volcanic Activity (Examples)</h1>
<p>Volcanic activity is the result of the movement of molten rock, or magma, from the Earth&#39;s mantle to its surface. The type of volcanic eruption and the resulting landforms depend on the composition of the magma, as well as the processes that occur as the magma rises through the Earth&#39;s crust.</p>
<p>There are several types of volcanic eruptions, including Hawaiian, Strombolian, Vulcanian, and Pelean. Hawaiian eruptions are characterized by the effusive eruption of low-viscosity, basaltic lava, and often form shield volcanoes. Strombolian eruptions are characterized by the explosive eruption of gas-rich, viscous lava, and often form cinder cones. Vulcanian eruptions are similar to Strombolian eruptions, but are more explosive and often form composite cones. Pelean eruptions are characterized by the release of viscous, gas-rich lava, and often form lava domes.</p>
<p>Volcanic landforms include volcanic cones, lava tubes, and pillow lava. Volcanic cones are formed by the accumulation of volcanic material, such as ash, lava, and rock fragments, around a volcanic vent. Lava tubes are formed when lava flows through the Earth&#39;s surface and cools, forming a hollow, tube-like structure. Pillow lava is formed when lava cools and solidifies rapidly upon contact with water, and is a common feature of mid-ocean ridges.</p>
<p>Volcanic activity is often associated with tectonic plate boundaries, such as subduction zones and mid-ocean ridges. Volcanic arcs, which are chains of volcanoes that form above subduction zones, are characterized by composite cones and Strombolian eruptions. Hotspots, which are areas of intense volcanic activity located away from tectonic plate boundaries, are characterized by shield volcanoes and Hawaiian eruptions. Examples of hotspots include the Hawaiian Islands and Yellowstone National Park.</p>
