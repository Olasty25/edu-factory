<li><strong>Vaccine</strong>: A preparation that is used to stimulate the body&#39;s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease</li>
<li><strong>Immunity</strong>: The condition of being protected against a specific disease</li>
<li><strong>Antigen</strong>: A substance (usually a protein) that is recognized by the immune system and stimulates an immune response</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive immune response</strong>: A type of immune response that is specific to a particular pathogen and involves the activation of T cells and B cells</li>
<li><strong>Memory cells</strong>: Immune cells that remain in the body after an initial immune response and provide long-term immunity to a specific pathogen</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notatki</h2>
<p>Vaccines are a powerful tool for preventing the spread of infectious diseases. They work by introducing a small, harmless piece of a pathogen (the agent that causes a disease) into the body, which stimulates the immune system to produce a response. This response includes the production of antibodies, which are proteins that recognize and bind to the pathogen, and the activation of immune cells, such as T cells and B cells.</p>
<p>There are several different types of vaccines, including live attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, and subunit vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines use a weakened form of the virus, while inactivated vaccines use a dead form of the virus. Subunit vaccines, on the other hand, use only a piece of the virus, such as a protein, to stimulate an immune response.</p>
<p>One of the key features of the immune system is its ability to remember past infections. When the immune system encounters a pathogen for the first time, it mounts a response to fight off the infection. Some of the immune cells that are involved in this response become memory cells, which remain in the body and provide long-term immunity to the specific pathogen. This is why vaccines are often able to provide protection against a disease for many years, or even for the rest of a person&#39;s life.</p>
<p>In summary, vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to produce an immune response, which includes the production of antibodies and the activation of immune cells. This response provides protection against a specific disease, and in some cases, it can also provide long-term immunity.</p>
