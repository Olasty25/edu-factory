<h1>Notes - Amino Acids: Structure and Properties (~200 words)</h1>
<p>Amino acids are fundamental building blocks of proteins and are composed of three main parts: a carboxylic acid group, an amino group, and a side chain. The carboxylic acid group and the amino group are linked by a central carbon atom, known as the alpha carbon, resulting in an amino acid&#39;s general formula being represented as H2N-Cα-COOH. The side chain, or R group, is unique to each of the 20 standard amino acids and is responsible for their various chemical properties.</p>
<p>The two main properties that characterize an amino acid&#39;s side chain are hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity. Hydrophilic amino acids have side chains that are attracted to water molecules, making them polar, while hydrophobic amino acids have side chains that are repelled by water molecules, making them nonpolar. The 20 standard amino acids are typically represented in diagrams and models using standard one-letter abbreviations, which are easy to recognize and use in diagrams and models.</p>
<p>Amino acids differ from each other in several ways, including their chemical structures, molecular weights, and electrical charges. Some amino acids have charged side chains, some have polar side chains, while others have nonpolar side chains. The unique properties of the side chains give each amino acid its distinct chemical properties and influence the arrangement of the amino acids within a protein.</p>
<p>Furthermore, amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds to form polypeptides, which are the primary building blocks of proteins. The unique arrangement of amino acids in a polypeptide chains determines the three-dimensional structure of a protein, which in turn determines its biological function and activity. The properties of the constituent amino acids, such as polarity and charge, play a significant role in determining how the protein will behave in different environments, such as in the cell or outside of it. Understanding the structure and properties of amino acids is crucial in the study of proteins, their function, folding, and interactions.</p>
