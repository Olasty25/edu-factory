<h1>Notes - Amino Acids: Building and Properties (~200 words)</h1>
<p>Amino acids are organic compounds containing both amino and carboxyl groups. They are the building blocks of proteins and are essential for the structure, function, and regulation of cells, tissues, and organs. There are 20 standard proteinogenic amino acids, each with a unique side chain (R group) that determines its chemical properties.</p>
<p>Amino acids can be classified into four groups based on their R groups: nonpolar (hydrophobic), polar (hydrophilic), positively charged (basic), and negatively charged (acidic). Hydrophobic amino acids, such as leucine, isoleucine, and tryptophan, tend to be located in the interior of proteins, while hydrophilic amino acids, such as serine, threonine, and tyrosine, are found on the surface of proteins and interact with the aqueous environment.</p>
<p>Positively charged amino acids, such as lysine and arginine, have a positive charge at physiological pH, while negatively charged amino acids, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid, have a negative charge at physiological pH. These charged amino acids play a crucial role in protein-protein interactions, protein folding, and protein targeting.</p>
<p>Amino acids also exhibit optical isomerism, meaning they can exist in two forms that are mirror images of each other, called D- and L-amino acids. Proteins are composed of L-amino acids, while D-amino acids are rare in nature and have different properties and functions.</p>
<p>In summary, amino acids are the basic building blocks of proteins, and their unique chemical properties determine the structure, function, and regulation of proteins and cells. Understanding the building and properties of amino acids is essential for understanding the biochemistry of life.</p>
