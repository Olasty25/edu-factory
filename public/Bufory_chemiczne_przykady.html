<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chemical buffers are solutions that resist changes in pH.</li>
<li>A buffer solution contains equal amounts of an acid and its conjugate base.</li>
<li>The pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.</li>
<li>Common buffers present in biological systems include phosphate, bicarbonate, and acetate.</li>
<li>Functions of buffers include regulating pH changes, preventing acidification, and preventing basicity.</li>
<li>Buffers are essential for the proper functioning of biochemical systems, as they maintain the pH within a narrow range that is optimal for enzyme activity.</li>
<li>Buffers can be created using a weak acid and its salt or a weak base and its salt.</li>
<li>Common laboratory buffers include acetate buffer, phosphate buffer, and borate buffer.</li>
<li>Buffer solutions have limited capacity and can be overwhelmed by large amounts of acids or bases added to them.</li>
<li>Buffers should be selected based on the desired pH range and the specific requirements of the application.</li>
<li>Buffers are widely used in laboratory research, diagnostic testing, and biotechnology applications.</li>
<li>Buffer solutions should be prepared and stored properly to maintain their stability and effectiveness.</li>
