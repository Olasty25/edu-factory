<li><strong>Buffer</strong> - A solution containing a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid.</li>
<li><strong>pH moderation</strong> - A buffer&#39;s ability to resist large pH changes due to input of small amounts of acids or bases.</li>
<li><strong>Buffer capacity</strong> - The amount of acid or base that can be added to a buffer before its pH changes significantly.</li>
<li><strong>pKa</strong> - A measure of the strength of an acid in solution.</li>
<li><strong>Henderson-Hasselbalch equation</strong> - A relationship used to calculated the pH of a buffer system.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>A buffer is a solution that resists changes in pH upon the addition of small amounts of acids or bases due to the presence of a weak acid or weak base and its conjugate partner. A buffer&#39;s capacity to resist pH change is limited, however, and it is important not to exceed the capacity of a buffer when performing acid-base reactions.</p>
<p>The pH of a solution is related to the ratio of the concentration of the weak acid to the concentration of conjugate base or vice versa. This relationship is summarized in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is as follows:</p>
<p>pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>pH is the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration</li>
<li>pKa is the negative logarithm of the dissociation constant of the weak acid</li>
<li>[A-] is the concentration of the base</li>
<li>[HA] is the concentration of the acid.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pKa value of a weak acid is a measure of its strength in solution and is related to the equilibrium constant for the reaction of the weak acid with water as follows:</p>
<p>pKa = -log(Ka)</p>
<p>Where Ka is the acid dissociation constant.</p>
<p>Common buffer systems include acetic acid and sodium acetate (commonly used in biochemistry), blood/bicarbonate ion, and ammonia and ammonium ion, among others. The choice of buffer system depends on the desired pH range and the particular application.</p>
<p>Buffers play an important role in a wide range of applications in chemistry, biology, medicine, and environmental science. In chemistry, they are used to maintain a constant pH during titrations and other acid-base reactions. In biology, they help maintain the pH of fluids such as blood, stomach acid, and other bodily fluids. In medicine, they are used in various diagnostic test and therapeutic interventions. Finally, in environmental science, buffers are used to mitigate the impact of pollutants on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
