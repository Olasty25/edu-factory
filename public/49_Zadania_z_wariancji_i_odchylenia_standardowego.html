<p>Variance is a statistical measure of dispersion, which indicates how far each number in a dataset is from the mean. It is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean. The formula for population variance is:</p>
<p>$\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \mu)^2$</p>
<p>While sample variance is calculated by:</p>
<p>$\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2$</p>
<p> where $N$ and $n$ are the population and sample sizes respectively, $x_i$ is an individual data point, $\mu$ is the population mean, $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean and $\sum$ is the sum of all individual squared differences.</p>
<p>The reason we divide by $n-1$ instead of $n$ in the case of sample variance is to correct the bias in the estimation of the population variance. By dividing by $n-1$, we get a better estimate of the population variance with a smaller sample size.</p>
<p>Standard deviation is another measure of dispersion, which is defined as the square root of the variance. The formula for population standard deviation is:</p>
<p>$\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \mu)^2}$</p>
<p>While sample standard deviation is calculated by:</p>
<p>$\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}$</p>
<p>Standard deviation, like variance, is measured in the same units as the original data. It is often preferred to variance because it has the same units as the original data, making it easier to interpret and compare than variance.</p>
<p>The coefficient of variation (CV) is a statistical measure that expresses the dispersion of a distribution in relation to its mean, calculated as $\frac{\sigma}{\mu}$ or $\frac{s}{\bar{x}}$. It is often expressed as a percentage and provides information on the spread of data relative to its mean, making it easy to compare the dispersion of different datasets.</p>
<p>In summary, Variance, Standard Deviation and the coefficient of variation are all measures of dispersion, which give us information about the spread of data. Variance is a measure of the average of the squared differences from the mean, Standard deviation is the square root of variance and Coefficient of Variation is the ratio of standard deviation to mean. It is important to keep track of the differences in calculating population and sample variance and standard deviation, by adjusting the denominator to $n-1$ in case of sample.</p>
