<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Advanced stoichiometric calculations involve determining the theoretical and actual yields of products, and the limiting reactant in a chemical reaction.</p>
<p>The limiting reactant is the reactant that is completely consumed during a reaction, and determines the theoretical yield of the product. To find the limiting reactant, you can use the stoichiometric amounts of each reactant. The reactant with the smaller stoichiometric amount is the limiting reactant.</p>
<p>The theoretical yield is the maximum amount of product that can be produced from a reaction, assuming all of the reactant is consumed and 100% efficiency. You can use the stoichiometric amounts of the reactants to calculate the theoretical yield.</p>
<p>The actual yield is the amount of product that is actually produced in a reaction. The percentage yield is the actual yield divided by the theoretical yield, expressed as a percentage. The percentage yield can be used to determine the efficiency of a reaction.</p>
<p>It&#39;s important to note that the actual yield may not equal the theoretical yield, due to incomplete reactions and other sources of error.</p>
<p>Excess reactant refers to a reactant that is present in amounts greater than the stoichiometric amount. In this case, the excess reactant does not limit the yield of product. Stoichiometric amount refers to the amount of reactant needed to react completely with a given amount of another reactant.</p>
<p>In conducting complete combustion, keep in mind that this is a type of reaction in which a compound reacts with an excess of oxygen to produce only carbon dioxide and water. This knowledge will help you to determine whether or not a reaction is complete combustion and help you predict the products.</p>
<p>Overall, understanding the concepts of stoichiometry, limiting reactant and yield will help you to understand and predict the outcome of chemical reactions, and to design efficient and effective chemical processes.</p>
