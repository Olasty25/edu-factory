<h1>Notes - United Nations: Goals and Structure</h1>
<p>The United Nations (UN) is an international organization founded in 1945 with the goal of promoting peace, security, and cooperation among its member states. The UN has six main organs: the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the International Court of Justice, the Secretariat, and the Trusteeship Council.</p>
<p>The General Assembly is the main deliberative body of the UN, where all member states are represented and have equal voting rights. The General Assembly is responsible for electing non-permanent members of the Security Council, appointing the Secretary-General, and approving the UN budget.</p>
<p>The Security Council is responsible for maintaining international peace and security, and has the power to impose sanctions and authorize the use of force. The Security Council has 15 members, including 5 permanent members (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and 10 non-permanent members elected for two-year terms.</p>
<p>The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is responsible for promoting international economic and social cooperation and development. ECOSOC has 54 members elected for three-year terms, and is responsible for making recommendations for international cooperation in the economic, social, cultural, educational, and health fields.</p>
<p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is the primary judicial organ of the UN, responsible for settling legal disputes between states and giving advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by other UN organs. The ICJ has 15 judges elected for nine-year terms.</p>
<p>The Secretariat is responsible for providing administrative support to the other UN organs and implementing their decisions. The Secretariat is headed by the Secretary-General, who is appointed by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council.</p>
<p>The Trusteeship Council was established to supervise the administration of trust territories, but its work has been completed and it is now inactive.</p>
<p>The UN&#39;s main goals are to maintain international peace and security, to protect human rights, to provide humanitarian aid, and to promote sustainable development. The UN works to achieve these goals through a variety of means, including diplomacy, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, and development programs. The UN also has a number of specialized agencies, such as the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children&#39;s Fund, that work to address specific global issues.</p>
