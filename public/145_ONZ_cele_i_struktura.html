<h1>Notes: United Nations - Goals and Structure</h1>
<p>The United Nations is an international organization founded in 1945 with the primary goal of maintaining international peace and security. The United Nations has 193 member states, making it the largest intergovernmental organization in the world. The United Nations is made up of six main organs: the General Assembly, Security Council, Economic and Social Council, Trusteeship Council, International Court of Justice, and the Secretariat.</p>
<p>The General Assembly is the main deliberative body of the United Nations, where all member states are represented. It makes recommendations on international issues and approves the budget of the United Nations. The Security Council is responsible for maintaining international peace and security, and it has the power to impose sanctions and authorize the use of force. The Economic and Social Council promotes international economic and social cooperation and development. The Trusteeship Council was established to supervise the administration of trust territories, but it has suspended its operations as all trust territories have attained self-government or independence. The International Court of Justice is the main judicial organ of the United Nations and settles legal disputes between states and gives advisory opinions. The Secretariat provides studies, information, and facilities needed by the United Nations.</p>
<p>The United Nations also has several specialized agencies, such as the World Health Organization, the International Labor Organization, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which work closely with the United Nations to achieve its goals. The United Nations also provides humanitarian assistance to people in need and works to protect human rights around the world.</p>
